# 👋 Hello! I'm bosnar

I’m bosnar — a backend engineer who loves building rock‑solid services in Go and Rust. I’m always on the hunt for cool new tech, 
whether it’s diving into React/Next.js for frontend fun or exploring the latest in systems programming. When I’m not coding, 
you’ll find me tinkering with side projects, learning something new, or sharing tips with fellow devs. Let’s build something awesome together!
